# Genre-Classification-Project-Machine-Learning-based-Audio-Analysis-and-Prediction
Developed and implemented a machine learning project utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify over 1000 different genre songs, achieving an impressive 83% accuracy rate in predicting audio genre. Conducted data preprocessing and analysis on a diverse dataset of audio recordings to extract relevant features for accurate genre classification.

My partner and I trained the code with 200 classified songs that won't be uploaded for conciseness. Then, we tested it song by song, and it guessed with 83% accuracy.
